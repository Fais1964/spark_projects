# BFRO Sightings Analysis with PySpark and Matplotlib

This is a PySpark project for analyzing Bigfoot sightings data from the [Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO)](https://www.bfro.net/). The data used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/cjgdev/bigfoot-sightings-data-set) and consists of geocoded sighting reports from across the United States.

## Project Overview

This project uses PySpark and Matplotlib to perform the following analyses:

1. Count the number of sightings per state and show the top 10 states with the most sightings.
2. Calculate the number of sightings per month and display a bar chart showing the distribution of sightings across the year.
3. Determine the most common classification of Bigfoot sightings.
